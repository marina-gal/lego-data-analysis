# Analyzing LEGO Dataset

This project is part of the *“100 Days of Python”* course by **Angela Yu (Udemy)**.  
It has been expanded and refined to demonstrate practical skills in **data cleaning**, **dataset merging**, **exploratory data analysis**, and **visualization** using Python.

The dataset used contains detailed information about LEGO pieces, themes, sets, and colors.  
The goal is to uncover long-term trends, relationships between themes and sets, and insights about the growth of the LEGO universe.
